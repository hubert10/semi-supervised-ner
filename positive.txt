7-eleven	each year on november 7	promotes `` 7-eleven day '' by giving away a free slurpee to customers.in april 2014 7-eleven announced plans to start operating stores in western australia with 11 stores planned to operate within the first year and a total of 75 stores established within five years
7-eleven	in august 2015 fairfax media and the abc 's four corners programme reported on the employment practices of certain	franchisees in australia
7-eleven	the investigation found that many	employees were being underpaid at rates of around a 10 to a 14 per hour before tax well under the legally-required minimum award rate of a 24.69 per hour.franchisees underpaying their staff would typically maintain rosters and pay records that would appear to show the employee being paid the legally-required rate however these records would in fact only include half of the hours the employee actually worked in a week
7-eleven	employees would then be paid on the basis of these records resulting in them effectively being paid half the legally-required rate.it was also reported that workers were often not paid loadings and penalty rates that they are legally entitled to for working overtime hours nights weekends and public holidays.after these reports came to light and received widespread attention some employees had alleged to fairfax media that they had begun to be paid correctly through the	payroll system however would then be asked by the franchisee to pay back half their wages in cash
7-eleven		subsequently announced they would fund an inquiry to investigate instances of wage fraud
7-eleven	the inquiry invited submissions from current and former	employees who allege they have been underpaid and assess each individual claim.in september 2015 chairman russ withers and chief executive warren wilmon announced they would resign from the company

amd	advanced micro devices inc.	is an american multinational semiconductor company based in santa clara california that develops computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets
amd		's main products include microprocessors motherboard chipsets embedded processors and graphics processors for servers workstations and personal computers and embedded systems applications
amd		is the second-largest supplier and only significant rival to intel in the market for x86-based microprocessors
amd	since acquiring ati in 2006	and its competitor nvidia have dominated the discrete graphics processing unit gpu market
amd	the previous year robert noyce who had invented the first practical integrated circuit or the microchip in 1959 at fairchild had left fairchild together with gordon moore and founded the semiconductor company intel in july 1968.in september 1969	moved from its temporary location in santa clara to sunnyvale california
amd	to immediately secure a customer base	initially became a second source supplier of microchips designed by fairchild and national semiconductor
amd		first focused on producing logic chips
amd	also in 1970	produced its first proprietary product the am2501 logic counter which was highly successful
amd	its best-selling product in 1971 was the am2505 the fastest multiplier available.in 1971	entered the ram chip market beginning with the am3101 a 64-bit bipolar ram
amd	that year	also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits and by year end the company 's total annual sales reached 4.6 million.amd went public in september 1972
amd	by 1975	was producing 212 products – of which 49 were proprietary including the am9102 a static n-channel 1024-bit ram and three low-power schottky msi circuits am25ls07 am25ls08 and am25ls09.intel had created the first microprocessor its 4-bit 4004 in 1971
amd	by 1975	entered the microprocessor market with the am9080 a reverse-engineered clone of the intel 8080 and the am2900 bit-slice microprocessor family
amd	when intel began installing microcode in its microprocessors in 1976 it entered into a cross-licensing agreement with	granting amd a copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals effective october 1976.in 1977 amd entered into a joint venture with siemens a german engineering conglomerate wishing to enhance its technology expertise and enter the u.s. market
amd	siemens purchased 20 of	's stock giving amd an infusion of cash to increase its product lines
amd	that year the two companies also jointly established advanced micro computers located in silicon valley and in germany giving	an opportunity to enter the microcomputer development and manufacturing field in particular based on amd 's second-source zilog z8000 microprocessors
amd	when the two companies vision for advanced micro computers diverged	bought out siemens stake in the u.s. division in 1979
amd		closed its advanced micro computers subsidiary in late 1981 after switching focus to manufacturing second-source intel x86 microprocessors.total sales in fiscal year 1978 topped 100 million and in 1979 amd debuted on the new york stock exchange
amd	in 1979 production also began in	's new semiconductor fab in austin texas the company already had overseas assembly facilities in penang and manila and it began construction on a semiconductor fab in san antonio in 1981
amd	in 1980	began supplying semiconductor products for telecommunications an industry undergoing rapid expansion and innovation
amd	intel and	entered into a 10-year technology exchange agreement first signed in october 1981 and formally executed in february 1982
amd	the main result of the 1982 agreement was that	became a second-source manufacturer of intel 's x86 microprocessors and related chips and intel provided amd with database tapes for its 8086 80186 and 80286 chips.beginning in 1982 amd began volume-producing second-source intel-licensed 8086 8088 80186 and 80188 processors and by 1984 its own am286 clone of intel 's 80286 processor for the rapidly growing market of ibm pcs and ibm clones
amd	that year	was listed in the book the 100 best companies to work for in america and based on 1984 income it made the fortune 500 list for the first time in 1985.by mid-1985 however the microchip market experienced a severe downturn mainly due to long-term aggressive trade practices dumping from japan but also due to a crowded and non-innovative chip market in the u.s. amd rode out the mid-1980s crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing devising the liberty chip program of designing and manufacturing one new chip or chip set per week for 52 weeks in fiscal year 1986 and by heavily lobbying the u.s. government until sanctions and restrictions were put in place to prevent predatory japanese pricing
amd	during this time period	withdrew from the dram market and at the same time made some headway into the cmos market which it had lagged in entering having focused instead on bipolar chips.amd had some success in the mid-1980s with the amd7910 and amd7911 `` world chip '' fsk modem one of the first multi-standard devices that covered both bell and ccitt tones at up to 1200 baud half duplex or 300/300 full duplex
amd	beginning in 1986	embraced the perceived shift toward risc with their own amd am29000 29k processor the 29k survived as an embedded processor
amd	throughout the 1980s	was a second-source supplier of intel x86 processors
amd	creating its own chips	began to compete directly with intel.amd had a large and successful flash memory business even during the dotcom bust
amd	in 2003 to divest some manufacturing and aid its overall cash flow which was under duress from aggressive microprocessor competition from intel	spun off its flash memory business and manufacturing into spansion a joint venture with fujitsu which had been co-manufacturing flash memory with amd since 1993
amd		divested itself of spansion in december 2005 in order to focus on the microprocessor market and spansion went public in an ipo
amd		announced the acquisition of the graphics processor company ati technologies on july 24 2006
amd		paid 4.3 billion in cash and 58 million shares of its stock for a total of approximately 5.4 billion
amd	on august 30 2010	announced that it would retire the ati brand name for its graphics chipsets in favor of the amd brand name.in october 2008 amd announced plans to spin off manufacturing operations in the form of a multibillion-dollar joint venture with advanced technology investment co. an investment company formed by the government of abu dhabi
amd	the partnership and spin-off gave	an infusion of cash and allowed amd to focus solely on chip design
amd	to assure the abu dhabi investors of the new venture 's success ceo hector ruiz stepped down as ceo of	in july 2008 while remaining executive chairman in preparation for becoming chairman of global foundries in march 2009
amd	president and coo dirk meyer became	's ceo
amd	recessionary losses necessitated	cutting 1,100 jobs in 2009.in august 2011 amd announced that former lenovo executive rory read would be joining the company as ceo replacing meyer
amd		announced in november 2011 plans to lay off more than 10 1,400 of its employees from across all divisions worldwide
amd	in october 2012 it announced plans to lay off an additional 15 of its workforce to reduce costs in the face of declining sales revenue.amd acquired the low-power server manufacturer seamicro in early 2012 with an eye to bringing out an arm architecture server chip.on october 8 2014	announced that rory read had stepped down after three years as president and chief executive officer
amd	he was succeeded by lisa su a key lieutenant who had been serving as chief operating officer since june.on october 16 2014	announced a new restructuring plan along with its q3 results
amd	effective july 1 2014	reorganized into two business groups computing and graphics which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets discrete gpus and professional graphics and enterprise embedded and semi-custom which primarily includes server and embedded processors dense servers semi-custom soc products including solutions for gaming consoles engineering services and royalties
amd	as part of this restructuring	announced that 7 of its global workforce would be laid off by the end of 2014
amd	in february 1982	signed a contract with intel becoming a licensed second-source manufacturer of 8086 and 8088 processors
amd		later produced the am286 under the same arrangement
amd	in 1984 intel in order to shore up its advantage in the marketplace internally decided to no longer cooperate with	in supplying product information and delayed and eventually refused to convey the technical details of the intel 80386 to amd
amd	in 1987	invoked arbitration over the issue and intel reacted by cancelling the 1982 technological-exchange agreement altogether
amd	after three years of testimony	eventually won in arbitration in 1992 but intel disputed this decision
amd	another long legal dispute followed ending in 1994 when the supreme court of california sided with the arbitrator and amd.in 1990 intel also countersued	renegotiating amd 's right to use derivatives of intel 's microcode for its cloned processors
amd	in the face of uncertainty during the legal dispute	was forced to develop clean-room designed versions of intel code for its x386 and x486 processors the former long after intel had released its own x386 in 1985
amd	in march 1991	released the am386 its clone of the intel 386 processor
amd	by october of the same year it had sold one million units.in 1993	introduced the first of the am486 family of processors which proved popular with a large number of original equipment manufacturers including compaq which signed an exclusive agreement using the am486
amd	another am486-based processor the am5x86 was released in november 1995 and continued	's success as a fast cost-effective processor.finally in an agreement effective 1996 amd received the rights to the microcode in intel 's x386 and x486 processor families but not the rights to the microcode in the following generations of processors
amd		's first in-house x86 processor was the k5 which was launched in 1996
amd	trademark and patent office had ruled that mere numbers could not be trademarked.in 1996	purchased nexgen specifically for the rights to their nx series of x86-compatible processors
amd		gave the nexgen design team their own building left them alone and gave them time and money to rework the nx686
amd	the k7 was	's seventh-generation x86 processor making its debut on june 23 1999 under the brand name athlon
amd	unlike previous	processors it could not be used on the same motherboards as intel 's due to licensing issues surrounding intel 's slot 1 connector and instead used a slot a connector referenced to the alpha processor bus
amd	shortly thereafter it was incorporated into a product for desktop pcs branded athlon 64.on april 21 2005	released the first dual core opteron an x86-based server cpu
amd	a month later	released the athlon 64 x2 the first desktop-based dual core processor family
amd	in may 2007	abandoned the string `` 64 '' in its dual-core desktop product branding becoming athlon x2 downplaying the significance of 64-bit computing in its processors
amd	in 2008	started to release dual-core sempron processors exclusively in china branded as the sempron 2000 series with lower hypertransport speed and smaller l2 cache
amd	thus	completed its dual-core product portfolio for each market segment
amd	in september 2007	released the first k10 processors third generation opteron processors followed in november by the phenom processor for desktop
amd		released a new platform codenamed `` spider '' which utilized the new phenom processor as well as an r770 gpu and a 790 gx/fx chipset from the amd 700 chipset series
amd	however	built the spider at 65nm which was uncompetitive with intel 's smaller and more power-efficient 45nm
amd	in january 2009	released a new processor line dubbed phenom ii a refresh of the original phenom built using the 45 nm process
amd		's new platform codenamed “ dragon ” utilized the new phenom ii processor and an ati r770 gpu from the r700 gpu family as well as a 790 gx/fx chipset from the amd 700 chipset series
amd	in april 2010	released a new phenom ii hexa-core 6-core processor codenamed `` thuban ''
amd	it included	's “ turbo core ” technology which allows the processor to automatically switch from 6 cores to 3 faster cores when more pure speed is needed
amd	following	's 2006 acquisition of canadian graphics company ati technologies an initiative codenamed fusion was announced to integrate a cpu and gpu together on some of amd 's microprocessors including a built in pci express link to accommodate separate pci express peripherals eliminating the northbridge chip from the motherboard
amd	the fusion was later renamed to the	apu accelerated processing unit .llano was amd 's first apu built for laptops
amd		suffered an unexpected decrease in revenue based on production problems for the llano
amd	bulldozer is	's microarchitecture codename for server and desktop amd fx processors first released on october 12 2011
amd		claims dramatic performance-per-watt efficiency improvements in high-performance computing hpc applications with bulldozer cores
amd	while hopes were very high that bulldozer would bring	to be performance competitive with archrival intel once more most benchmarks were disappointing
amd	piledriver would be released in	fx apu and opteron product lines
amd	used exclusively in	's apus steamroller focused on greater parallelism.in 2015 the excavator microarchitecture replaced piledriver
amd	the bobcat microarchitecture was revealed during a speech from	executive vice-president henri richard in computex 2007 and was put into production q1 2011
amd	based on the difficulty competing in the x86 market with a single core optimized for the 10–100 w range	had developed a simpler core with a target range of 1–10 watts
amd	in addition it was believed that the core could migrate into the hand-held space if the power consumption can be reduced to less than 1 w.jaguar is a microarchitecture codename for bobcat 's successor released in 2013 that is used in various apus from	aimed at the low-power/low-cost market
amd	in 2012	announced it was working on an arm architecture products both as a semi-custom product and server product
amd	the a1100 was also criticed for not having support from major vendors upon its release.in 2014	also announced the k12 custom core for release in 2016
amd	while arm architecture development continued products based on k12 were subsequently delayed with no release planned in preference to the development of	's x86 based zen microarchitecture
amd	zen is a new architecture for x86-64 based ryzen series cpus and apus introduced in 2017 by	and built from the ground up by a team led by jim keller beginning with his arrival in 2012 and taping out before his departure in september 2015
amd	one of	's primary goals with zen was an ipc increase of at least 40 however in february 2017 amd announced that they had actually achieved a 52 increase
amd	previous processors from	were either built in the 32 nm process `` bulldozer '' and `` piledriver '' cpus or the 28 nm process `` steamroller '' and `` excavator '' apus
amd	the zen architecture is the first to encompass cpus and apus from	built for a single socket socket am4
amd		released the zen-based high-end ryzen 7 `` summit ridge '' series cpus on march 2 2017 mid-range ryzen 5 series cpus on april 11 2017 and entry level ryzen 3 series cpus on july 27 2017
amd		later released the epyc line of zen derived server processors for 1p and 2p systems
amd	in october 2017	released zen based apus as ryzen mobile incorporating vega graphics cores
amd	in january 2018	has announced their new lineup plans with ryzen 2
amd	in early january 2018 it was reported that	processors are subject to the two variants of the security flaw dubbed spectre
amd		originally acknowledged vulnerability to one of the spectre variants gpz variant 1 but stated that vulnerability to another gpz variant 2 had not been demonstrated on amd processors claiming it posed a `` near zero risk of exploitation '' due to differences in amd architecture
amd	in an update nine days later	said that `` gpz variant 2…is applicable to amd processors '' and defined upcoming steps to mitigate the threat
amd	several sources took	's news of the vulnerability to gpz variant 2 as a change from amd 's prior claim though amd maintained that their position had not changed.in march 2018 security flaws specific to amd 's zen microarchitecture were announced which exploited vulnerabilities in the chips secure enclave and asmedia designed chipset
amd	by may 2018	had delivered patches to partners mitigating all the vulnerabilities
amd	the acquisition consideration closed on october 25 2006 and included over 2 billion financed from a loan and 56 million shares of	stock
amd	ati 's operations became part of the	graphics product group gpg and ati 's ceo dave orton became the executive vice president of visual and media businesses at amd until his resignation in 2007
amd	the top-level management was reorganized with the senior vice president and general manager and the senior vice president and general manager of consumer electronics group both of whom would report to the ceo of	
amd	on 30 august 2010 john trikola announced that	would retire the ati brand for its graphics chipsets in favor of the amd name
amd	in 2008 the ati division of	released the terascale microarchitecture implementing a unified shader model
amd	in a 2009 restructuring	merged the cpu and gpu divisions to support the companies apu 's which fused both graphics and general purpose processing
amd	in 2011	released the successor to terascale graphics core next gcn
amd	this new microarchitecture emphasized gpgpu compute capability in addition to graphics processing with a particular aim of supporting heterogeneous computing on	's apus
amd	in september 2015	separated the graphics technology division of the company into an independent internal unit called the radeon technology group rtg headed by raja koduri
amd	this gave the graphics division of	autonomy in product design and marketing
amd	in 2012	's then ceo rory read began a program to offer semi-custom designs
amd	rather than	simply designing and offering a single product potential customers could work with amd to design a custom chip based on amd 's intellectual property
amd	in particular	noted their unique position of offering both x86 and graphics intellectual property
amd	in november 2017	and intel announced that intel would market a product combining in a single package an intel core cpu a semi-custom amd radeon gpu and hbm2 memory
amd	before the launch of athlon 64 processors in 2003	designed chipsets for their processors spanning the k6 and k7 processor generations
amd	the situation changed in 2003 with the release of athlon 64 processors and	chose not to further design its own chipsets for its desktop processors while opening the desktop platform to allow other firms to design chipsets
amd	the initiative went further with the release of opteron server processors as	stopped the design of server chipsets in 2004 after releasing the amd-8111 chipset and again opened the server platform for firms to develop chipsets for opteron processors
amd		then renamed the chipsets for amd processors under amd branding for instance the crossfire xpress 3200 chipset was renamed as amd 580x crossfire chipset
amd	in february 2007	announced the first amd-branded chipset since 2004 with the release of the amd 690g chipset previously under the development codename rs690 targeted at mainstream igp computing
amd	although	stated the firm would still produce intel chipsets intel had not granted the license of 1333 mhz fsb to ati
amd	on november 15 2007	announced a new chipset series portfolio the amd 7-series chipsets covering from enthusiast multi-graphics segment to value igp segment to replace the amd 480/570/580 chipsets and amd 690 series chipsets marking amd 's first enthusiast multi-graphics chipset
amd		returned to the server chipsets market with the amd 800s series server chipsets
amd	with the advent of	's apus in 2011 traditional north bridge features such as the connection to graphics and the pci express controller were incorporated into the apu die
amd	in february 2002	acquired alchemy semiconductor for its alchemy line of mips processors for the hand-held and portable media player markets
amd	on june 13 2006	officially announced that the line was to be transferred to raza microelectronics inc. a designer of mips processors for embedded applications.in august 2003 amd also purchased the geode business which was originally the cyrix mediagx from national semiconductor to augment its existing line of embedded x86 processor products
amd		has also introduced 64-bit processors into its embedded product line starting with the amd opteron processor
amd	in 2007	added the amd athlon amd turion and mobile amd sempron processors to its embedded product line
amd	leveraging the same 64-bit instruction set and direct connect architecture as the	opteron but at lower power levels these processors were well suited to a variety of traditional embedded applications
amd	throughout 2007 and into 2008	has continued to add both single-core mobile amd sempron and amd athlon processors and dual-core amd athlon x2 and amd turion processors to its embedded product line and now offers embedded 64-bit solutions starting with 8w tdp mobile amd sempron and amd athlon processors for fan-less designs up to multi-processor systems leveraging multi-core amd opteron processors all supporting longer than standard availability.the ati acquisition in 2006 included the imageon and xilleon product lines
amd	also in 2008 the xilleon division was sold to broadcom.in april 2007	announced the release of the m690t integrated graphics chipset for embedded designs
amd	this enabled	to offer complete processor and chipset solutions targeted at embedded applications requiring high-performance 3d and video such as emerging digital signage kiosk and point of sale applications
amd	in january 2011	announced the amd embedded g-series accelerated processing unit
amd	these were followed by updates to the in 2013 and 2016.in may 2012	announced the amd embedded r-series accelerated processing unit
amd		builds graphic processors for use in embedded systems
amd	since that time	has released regular updates to their embedded gpu lineup in 2009 2011 2015 and 2016 reflecting improvements in their gpu technology

dell		is an american multinational computer technology company based in round rock texas united states that develops sells repairs and supports computers and related products and services
dell	named after its founder michael	the company is one of the largest technological corporations in the world employing more than 103,300 people in america and around the world
dell		sells personal computers pcs servers data storage devices network switches software computer peripherals hdtvs cameras printers mp3 players and electronics built by other manufacturers
dell		was a pure hardware vendor for much of its existence but with the acquisition in 2009 of perot systems dell entered the market for it services
dell		is currently the 1 shipper of pc monitors in the world
dell		is the sixth largest company in texas by total revenue according to fortune magazine
dell	it was a publicly traded company nasdaq	as well as a component of the nasdaq-100 and s p 500 until it was taken private in a leveraged buyout which closed on october 30 2013
dell	in 2016	acquired the enterprise technology firm emc corporation following the completion of the purchase dell and emc became divisions of dell technologies
dell		traces its origins to 1984 when michael dell created dell computer corporation which at the time did business as pc 's limited while a student of the university of texas at austin
dell		dropped out of school to focus full-time on his fledgling business after getting 1,000 in expansion-capital from his family
dell	in 1986 michael	brought in lee walker a 51-year-old venture capitalist as president and chief operating officer to serve as dell 's mentor and implement dell 's ideas for growing the company
dell	walker retired in 1990 due to health and michael	hired morton meyerson former ceo and president of electronic data systems to transform the company from a fast-growing medium-sized firm into a billion-dollar enterprise.the company dropped the pc ’ s limited name in 1987 to become dell computer corporation and began expanding globally
dell	in june 1988	's market capitalization grew by 30 million to 80 million from its june 22 initial public offering of 3.5 million shares at 8.50 a share
dell	in 1992 fortune magazine included	computer corporation in its list of the world 's 500 largest companies making michael dell the youngest ceo of a fortune 500 company ever.in 1993 to complement its own direct sales channel dell planned to sell pcs at big-box retail outlets such as wal-mart which would have brought in an additional 125 million in annual revenue
dell	bain consultant kevin rollins persuaded michael	to pull out of these deals believing they would be money losers in the long run
dell	margins at retail were thin at best and	left the reseller channel in 1994
dell	rollins would soon join	full-time and eventually become the company president and ceo
dell	originally	did not emphasize the consumer market due to the higher costs and unacceptably low-profit margins in selling to individuals and households this changed when the company ’ s internet site took off in 1996 and 1997
dell	while the industry ’ s average selling price to individuals was going down	's was going up as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing dell
dell		found an opportunity among pc-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct customizing their pc to their means and having it delivered in days
dell	in early 1997	created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual users.from 1997 to 2004 dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps
dell		surpassed compaq to become the largest pc manufacturer in 1999
dell	operating costs made up only 10 percent of	's 35 billion in revenue in 2002 compared with 21 percent of revenue at hewlett-packard 25 percent at gateway and 46 percent at cisco
dell	in 2002 when compaq merged with hewlett packard the fourth-place pc maker the newly combined hewlett packard took the top spot but struggled and	soon regained its lead
dell		grew the fastest in the early 2000s.dell attained and maintained the top rating in pc reliability and customer service/technical support according to consumer reports year after year during the mid-to-late 90s through 2001 right before windows xp was released
dell	in 1996	began selling computers through its website
dell	in the mid-1990s	expanded beyond desktop computers and laptops by selling servers starting with low-end servers
dell		's new poweredge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies as they ran microsoft windows nt on intel chips and could be built cheaper than its competitors
dell	consequently	's enterprise revenues almost nonexistent in 1994 accounted for 13 percent of the company 's total intake by 1998
dell	three years later	passed compaq as the top provider of intel-based servers with 31 percent of the market
dell		's first acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of convergenet technologies for 332 million after dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system in-house convergenet 's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with dell 's commodity-producer business model forcing dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition.in 2002 dell expanded its product line to include televisions handhelds digital audio players and printers
dell	chairman and ceo michael	had repeatedly blocked president and coo kevin rollins 's attempt to lessen the company 's heavy dependency on pcs which rollins wanted to fix by acquiring emc corporation.in 2003 the company was rebranded as simply `` dell inc. '' to recognize the company 's expansion beyond computers.in 2004 michael dell resigned as ceo while retaining the position of chairman handing the ceo title to kevin rollins who had been president and coo since 2001
dell	despite no longer holding the ceo title	essentially acted as a de facto co-ceo with rollins.under rollins dell acquired alienware a manufacturer of high-end pcs targeted mainly towards the gaming market
dell	by june 2006 the stock traded around 25 usd which was 40 down from july 2005—the high-water mark of the company in the post-dotcom era.the slowing sales growth has been attributed to the maturing pc market which constituted 66 of	's sales and analysts suggested that dell needed to make inroads into non-pc businesses segments such as storage services and servers
dell		's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop pcs but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company 's supply chain and as competitors such as hewlett-packard and acer made their pc manufacturing operations more efficient to match dell weakening dell 's traditional price differentiation
dell	throughout the entire pc industry declines in prices along with commensurate increases in performance meant that	had fewer opportunities to upsell to their customers a lucrative strategy of encouraging buyers to upgrade the processor or memory
dell	the laptop segment had become the fastest-growing of the pc market but	produced low-cost notebooks in china like other pc manufacturers which eliminated dell 's manufacturing cost advantages plus dell 's reliance on internet sales meant that it missed out on growing notebook sales in big box stores
dell	cnet has suggested that	was getting trapped in the increasing commoditization of high volume low margin computers which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded.despite plans of expanding into other global regions and product segments dell was heavily dependent on u.s. corporate pc market as desktop pcs sold to both commercial and corporate customers accounted for 32 percent of its revenue 85 percent of its revenue comes from businesses and sixty-four percent of its revenue comes from north and south america according to its 2006 third-quarter results
dell	heavily depending on pcs	had to slash prices to boost sales volumes while demanding deep cuts from suppliers.dell had long stuck by its direct sales model
dell		's rivals in the pc industry hp gateway and acer had a long retail presence and so were well poised to take advantage of the consumer shift
dell	the lack of a retail presence stymied	's attempts to offer consumer electronics such as flat-panel tvs and mp3 players
dell		responded by experimenting with mall kiosks plus quasi-retail stores in texas and new york.dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon supply chain efficiencies to sell established technologies at low prices instead of being an innovator
dell		's low spending on r d relative to its revenue compared to ibm hewlett packard and apple inc. —which worked well in the commoditized pc market—prevented it from making inroads into more lucrative segments such as mp3 players and later mobile devices
dell		had done well with a horizontal organization that focused on pcs when the computing industry moved to horizontal mix-and-match layers in the 1980s but by the mid-2000 the industry shifted to vertically integrated stacks to deliver complete it solutions and dell lagged far behind competitors like hewlett packard and oracle.dell 's reputation for poor customer service since 2002 which was exacerbated as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure came under increasing scrutiny on the web
dell	the original	model was known for high customer satisfaction when pcs sold for thousands but by the 2000s the company could not justify that level of service when computers in the same lineup sold for hundreds
dell	hunter who noted that	's dna of cost-cutting `` got in the way '' aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call
dell	by 2006	had spent 100 million in just a few months to improve on this and rolled out dellconnect to answer customer inquiries more quickly
dell	in july 2006 the company started its direct2dell blog and then in february 2007 michael	launched ideastorm.com asking customers for advice including selling linux computers and reducing the promotional `` bloatware '' on pcs
dell	these initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49 to 22 as well as reduce the ``	hell '' prominent on internet search engines.there was also criticism that dell used faulty components for its pcs particularly the 11.8 million optiplex desktop computers sold to businesses and governments from may 2003 to july 2005 that suffered from bad capacitors made by a company called nichicon
dell	a battery recall in august 2006 as a result of a	laptop catching fire caused much negative attention for the company though later sony was found responsible for the faulty batteries.2006 marked the first year that dell 's growth was slower than the pc industry as a whole
dell	by the fourth quarter of 2006	lost its title of the largest pc manufacturer to rival hewlett packard whose personal systems group was invigorated thanks to a restructuring initiated by their ceo mark hurd.after four out of five quarterly earnings reports were below expectations rollins resigned as president and ceo on january 31 2007 and founder michael dell assumed the role of ceo again
dell		announced a change campaign called `` dell 2.0 '' reducing the number of employees and diversifying the company 's products
dell	while chairman of the board after relinquishing his ceo position michael	still had significant input in the company during rollins years as ceo
dell	with the return of michael	as ceo the company saw immediate changes in operations the exodus of many senior vice-presidents and new personnel brought in from outside the company
dell	michael	announced a number of initiatives and plans part of the `` dell 2.0 '' initiative to improve the company 's financial performance
dell	these include elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees with some discretionary awards reduction in the number of managers reporting directly to michael	from 20 to 12 and reduction of `` bureaucracy ''
dell	jim schneider retired as cfo and was replaced by donald carty as the company came under an sec probe for its accounting practices.on april 23 2008	announced the closure of one of its biggest canadian call-centers in kanata ontario terminating approximately 1100 employees with 500 of those redundancies effective on the spot and with the official closure of the center scheduled for the summer
dell	less than a year later	planned to double its workforce to nearly 3,000 workers add a new building
dell	these plans were reversed due to a high canadian dollar that made the ottawa staff relatively expensive and also as part of	's turnaround which involved moving these call-center jobs offshore to cut costs
dell	in total	announced the ending of about 8,800 jobs in 2007–2008 — 10 of its workforce.by the late 2000s dell 's `` configure to order '' approach of manufacturing—delivering individual pcs configured to customer specifications from its us facilities was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume asian contract manufacturers as pcs became powerful low-cost commodities
dell		closed plants that produced desktop computers for the north american market including the mort topfer manufacturing center in austin texas original location and lebanon tennessee opened in 1999 in 2008 and early 2009 respectively
dell		's contract with the state required them to repay the incentives for failing to meet the conditions and they sold the north carolina plant to herbalife
dell	most of the work that used to take place in	's u.s. plants was transferred to contract manufacturers in asia and mexico or some of dell 's own factories overseas
dell	the miami florida facility of its alienware subsidiary remains in operation while	continues to produce its servers its most profitable products in austin texas
dell	on january 8 2009	announced the closure of its manufacturing plant in limerick ireland with the loss of 1,900 jobs and the transfer of production to its plant in łodź in poland.the release of apple 's ipad tablet computer had a negative impact on dell and other major pc vendors as consumers switched away from desktop and laptop pcs
dell		's own mobility division has not managed success with developing smartphones or tablets whether running windows or google android
dell	the	streak was a failure commercially and critically due to its outdated os numerous bugs and low resolution screen
dell	infoworld suggested that	and other oems saw tablets as a short-term low-investment opportunity running google android an approach that neglected user interface and failed to gain long term market traction with consumers
dell		has responded by pushing higher-end pcs such as the xps line of notebooks which do not compete with the apple ipad and kindle fire tablets
dell	the growing popularity of smartphones and tablet computers instead of pcs drove	's consumer segment to an operating loss in q3 2012
dell	in december 2012	suffered its first decline in holiday sales in five years despite the introduction of windows 8.in the shrinking pc industry dell continued to lose market share as it dropped below lenovo in 2011 to fall to number three in the world
dell		and fellow american contemporary hewlett packard came under pressure from asian pc manufacturers lenovo asus and acer all of which had lower production costs and willing to accept lower profit margins
dell	in addition while the asian pc vendors had been improving their quality and design for instance lenovo 's thinkpad series was winning corporate customers away from	's laptops dell 's customer service and reputation had been slipping
dell		remained the second-most profitable pc vendor as it took 13 percent of operating profits in the pc industry during q4 2012 behind apple inc. 's macintosh that took 45 percent seven percent at hewlett packard six percent at lenovo and asus and one percent for acer.dell has been attempting to offset its declining pc business which still accounted for half of its revenue and generates steady cash flow by expanding into the enterprise market with servers networking software and services
dell		also managed some success in taking advantage of its high-touch direct sales heritage to establish close relationships and design solutions for clients
dell		's market share in the corporate segment was previously a `` moat '' against rivals but this has no longer been the case as sales and profits have fallen precipitously
dell	after several weeks of rumors which started around january 11 2013	announced on february 5 2013 that it had struck a 24.4 billion leveraged buyout deal that would have delisted its shares from the nasdaq and hong kong stock exchange and taken it private
dell	reuters reported that michael	and silver lake partners aided by a 2 billion loan from microsoft would acquire the public shares at 13.65 apiece
dell	it is also the largest technology buyout ever surpassing the 2006 buyout of freescale semiconductor for 17.5 billion.the founder of	michael dell said of the february offer `` i believe this transaction will open an exciting new chapter for dell our customers and team members ''
dell		rival lenovo reacted to the buyout saying `` the financial actions of some of our traditional competitors will not substantially change our outlook '' .in march 2013 the blackstone group and carl icahn expressed interest in purchasing dell
dell	other private equity firms such as kkr co. and tpg capital declined to submit alternative bids for	citing the uncertain market for personal computers and competitive pressures so the `` wide-open bidding war '' never materialized
dell	analysts said that the biggest challenge facing silver lake would be to find an “ exit strategy ” to profit from its investment which would be when the company would hold an ipo to go public again and one warned “ but even if you can get a 25bn enterprise value for	it will take years to get out. ” in may 2013 dell joined his board in voting for his offer
dell	the 13.88 cash offer plus a .08 per share dividend for the third fiscal quarter was accepted on september 12 and closed on october 30 2013 ending	's 25-year run as a publicly traded company
dell	after the buyout the newly private	offered a voluntary separation programme that they expected to reduce their workforce by up to seven percent
dell	the reception to the program so exceeded the expectations that	may be forced to hire new staff to make up for the losses.on november 19 2015 dell alongside arm holdings cisco systems intel microsoft and princeton university founded the openfog consortium to promote interests and development in fog computing.in july 2018 dell announced intentions to become a publicly-traded company again by paying 21.7 billion in both cash and stock to buy back shares from its stake in vmware
dell	on october 12 2015	announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company emc corporation
dell	at 67 billion it has been labeled the `` highest-valued tech acquisition in history '' .the announcement came two years after	inc. returned to private ownership claiming that it faced bleak prospects and would need several years out of the public eye to rebuild its business
dell	the wall street journal estimated that in 2014	had revenue of 27.3 billion from personal computers and 8.9bn from servers while emc had 16.5bn from emc ii 1bn from rsa security 6bn from vmware and 230 million from pivotal software
dell	the proposed acquisition will maintain vmware as a separate company held via a new tracking stock while the other parts of emc will be rolled into	
dell	once the acquisition closes	will again publish quarterly financial results having ceased these on going private in 2013.the combined business was expected to address the markets for scale-out architecture converged infrastructure and private cloud computing playing to the strengths of both emc and dell
dell	commentators have questioned the deal with fbr capital markets saying that though it makes a `` ton of sense '' for	it 's a `` nightmare scenario that would lack strategic synergies '' for emc
dell	fortune said there was a lot for	to like in emc 's portfolio but `` does it all add up enough to justify tens of billions of dollars for the entire package
dell	key investors backing the deal besides	were singapore 's temasek holdings and silver lake partners.on september 7 2016 dell completed its acquisition of emc
dell	post-acquisition	was re-organized with a new parent company dell technologies dell 's consumer and workstation businesses are internally referred to as the dell client solutions group and is one of the company 's three main business divisions alongside dell emc and vmware

equifax	following the announcement of the may–july 2017 breach	's actions received widespread criticism
equifax		did not immediately disclose whether pins and other sensitive information were compromised nor did it explain the delay between its discovery of the breach in july and its public announcement in early september

equifax	for roughly half the us population both of the latter pieces of data are known to be in possession of criminals following	's may–july 2017 security breach
equifax	on october 12 2017	's website was reported to have been offering visitors malware via drive-by download
equifax	at that time only 3 out of 65 top anti-malware products provided protection against the particular malware meaning that many visitors were at risk of having their computers infected if visiting the	website.on october 13 2017 the attack was revealed to have been performed by hijacking third-party analytics javascript from digital river brand fireclick.also on october 13 2017 the u.s. internal revenue service was reported to have suspended a 7.2 million contract with equifax as a result of the attack

equinix	the largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of may 2015 when	said it would purchase the british company telecitygroup
equinix	the offer was cleared by the european commission in november but only after	agreed to sell eight of its data centers around europe to digital realty trust for 874 million
equinix	in january 2016	announced that it had completed the telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately 3.8 billion
equinix	the addition of these data centers more than doubled	’ s capacity in europe making the company the region ’ s largest retail colocation provider
equinix	the deal also added network and cloud density.the size of the deal raised questions about	’ s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term

equinix	some analysts have warned that long-term consolidation in the telecommunications industry caused by cloud will decrease demand for data center space and hurt the growth prospects of companies such as	
equinix		argues that accelerated cloud proliferation and adoption along with the emergence of cloud-dependent trends and technologies such as big data mobile and the internet of things dramatically increase the value of its core interconnection offering.equinix was described by an industry analyst as a “ crucial middle man ” connecting companies that build private clouds on the equinix platform to the underlying networks and public cloud providers they depend on

equinix	this strategy is designed to allow the enterprise to move closer to end users by capitalizing on	’ s global footprint and the access it provides to multiple networks and cloud providers
equinix	the firm also said its interest in cultivating enterprise growth was to ward off the threat presented by the largest public cloud providers all of whom it hosts in its data centers.some analysts have argued that the continued growth of the public cloud giants – such as amazon web services and microsoft azure – would eventually lead them to abandon third-party colocation providers like	and build their own data centers and take advantage of economies of scale
equinix	in response	has positioned its facilities as meeting places where enterprises could directly access as many public cloud services as possible and build customized and business-critical applications
equinix	the company believes that attracting more enterprises as they begin relying on multi-cloud strategies will further establish	as an essential interconnection point between the enterprise and the public cloud including its largest providers
equinix	the pledge followed criticism in 2014 from the environmental group greenpeace which said in an annual report on the environmental practices of internet companies that	had an insufficient commitment to renewable energy and carbon emissions mitigation

nasdaq-100	the	began on january 31 1985 by the nasdaq trying to promote itself in the shadow of the new york stock exchange
nasdaq-100	by creating these two indices the nasdaq hoped that options and futures contracts would be created on them and mutual funds would adopt them as their benchmarks.the base price of the index was initially set at 250 but when it closed near 800 on december 31 1993 the base was reset at 125 the following trading day leaving the halved	price below that of the more commonly known nasdaq composite
nasdaq-100	the	with much of the broader market experienced a limit down open on october 24 and reached a 6-year intraday low of 1,018 on november 20 2008.amid quantitative easing qe from the federal reserve and optimism that the financial crisis was ending the index embarked on a volatile four-year climb higher closing above 3,000 on may 15 2013 for the first time since november 15 2000
nasdaq-100	the	is often abbreviated as ndx in the derivatives markets
nasdaq-100	it was formerly called	trust series 1

nasdaq-100	the	is frequently confused with the nasdaq composite index
nasdaq-100	the latter index often referred to simply as `` the nasdaq '' includes the stock of every company that is listed on nasdaq more than 3,000 altogether and is quoted more frequently than the	in popular media.the nasdaq-100 is a modified capitalization-weighted index
nasdaq-100	this particular methodology was created in 1998 in advance of the creation the	index trust which holds portions of all nasdaq-100 firms
nasdaq-100	in may 2011 nasdaq did a major rebalance of the index to bring it closer to market-cap weighting.the index is rebalanced only if one company is worth 24 of the index companies with a weighting of at least 4.5 make up 48 or more of the index in addition to its lack of financial companies the	includes 12 stocks of 11 companies incorporated outside the united states

intel		corporation stylized as intel is an american multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in santa clara california in the silicon valley
intel		supplies processors for computer system manufacturers such as apple lenovo hp and dell
intel		also manufactures motherboard chipsets network interface controllers and integrated circuits flash memory graphics chips embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing
intel		corporation was founded on july 18 1968 by semiconductor pioneers robert noyce and gordon moore of moore 's law and widely associated with the executive leadership and vision of andrew grove
intel	the fact that ``	'' is the term for intelligence information also made the name appropriate
intel		was an early developer of sram and dram memory chips which represented the majority of its business until 1981
intel	although	created the world 's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971 it was not until the success of the personal computer pc that this became its primary business
intel	during the 1990s	invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry
intel	during this period	became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for pcs and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market position particularly against amd advanced micro devices as well as a struggle with microsoft for control over the direction of the pc industry.the open source technology center at intel hosts powertop and latencytop and supports other open-source projects such as wayland mesa3d intel array building blocks and threading building blocks tbb and xen
intel		security group – 4 of 2016 revenues – produces software particularly security and antivirus software
intel	in 2016 dell accounted for about 15 of	's total revenues lenovo accounted for 13 of total revenues and hp inc. accounted for 11 of total revenues
intel	according to idc while	enjoyed the biggest market share in both the overall worldwide pc microprocessor market 73.3 and the mobile pc microprocessor 80.4 in the second quarter of 2011 the numbers decreased by 1.5 and 1.9 compared to the first quarter of 2011
intel	in the 1980s	was among the top ten sellers of semiconductors 10th in 1987 in the world
intel	in 1992	became the biggest chip maker by revenue and has held the position ever since
intel		's competitors in networking include nxp semiconductors infineon broadcom limited marvell technology group and applied micro circuits corporation and competitors in flash memory include spansion samsung qimonda toshiba stmicroelectronics and sk hynix
intel	the only major competitor in the x86 processor market is advanced micro devices amd with which	has had full cross-licensing agreements since 1976 each partner can use the other 's patented technological innovations without charge after a certain time
intel	since over 95 of the world 's smartphones currently use processors designed by arm holdings arm has become a major competitor for	's processor market
intel		was founded in mountain view california in 1968 by gordon e. moore of `` moore 's law '' fame a chemist and robert noyce a physicist and co-inventor of the integrated circuit
intel	moore and noyce had left fairchild semiconductor to found	
intel	the total initial investment in	was 2.5 million convertible debentures and 10,000 from rock
intel	just 2 years later	became a public company via an initial public offering ipo raising 6.8 million 23.50 per share
intel		's third employee was andy grove a chemical engineer who later ran the company through much of the 1980s and the high-growth 1990s
intel	instead they founded the company as n m electronics on july 18 1968 but by the end of the month had changed the name to	which stood for integrated electronics
intel	since ``	'' was already trademarked by the hotel chain intelco they had to buy the rights for the name
intel	at its founding	was distinguished by its ability to make logic circuits using semiconductor devices
intel	in the same year	also produced the 3301 schottky bipolar 1024-bit read-only memory rom and the first commercial metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor mosfet silicon gate sram chip the 256-bit 1101
intel		's business grew during the 1970s as it expanded and improved its manufacturing processes and produced a wider range of products still dominated by various memory devices
intel	while	created the first commercially available microprocessor intel 4004 in 1971 and one of the first microcomputers in 1972 by the early 1980s its business was dominated by dynamic random-access memory chips
intel	the growing success of the ibm personal computer based on an	microprocessor was among factors that convinced gordon moore ceo since 1975 to shift the company 's focus to microprocessors and to change fundamental aspects of that business model
intel	moore 's decision to sole-source	's 386 chip played into the company 's continuing success
intel	the development of the micro-processor by	1971 the micro-processor represented a notable advance in the technology of integrated circuitry
intel	considerable technological innovation was needed before the micro-processor could actually become the basis of what was first known as a `` mini computer '' and then known as a `` personal computer '' .by the end of the 1980s buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to ibm and ibm 's competitors within the rapidly growing personal computer market	embarked on a 10-year period of unprecedented growth as the primary and most profitable hardware supplier to the pc industry part of the winning 'wintel combination
intel	by launching its	inside marketing campaign in 1991 intel was able to associate brand loyalty with consumer selection so that by the end of the 1990s its line of pentium processors had become a household name
intel	competitors notably amd	's largest competitor in its primary x86 architecture market garnered significant market share initially in low-end and mid-range processors but ultimately across the product range and intel 's dominant position in its core market was greatly reduced
intel		had also for a number of years been embroiled in litigation
intel	us law did not initially recognize intellectual property rights related to microprocessor topology circuit layouts until the semiconductor chip protection act of 1984 a law sought by	and the semiconductor industry association sia
intel	during the late 1980s and 1990s after this law was passed	also sued companies that tried to develop competitor chips to the 80386 cpu
intel	the lawsuits were noted to significantly burden the competition with legal bills even if	lost the suits
intel	antitrust allegations had been simmering since the early 1990s and had been the cause of one lawsuit against	in 1991
intel	in 2004 and 2005 amd brought further claims against	related to unfair competition
intel	in 2006	unveiled its core microarchitecture to widespread critical acclaim the product range was perceived as an exceptional leap in processor performance that at a stroke regained much of its leadership of the field
intel	in 2008	had another `` tick '' when it introduced the penryn microarchitecture which was 45 nm
intel	later that year	released a processor with the nehalem architecture
intel	on june 27 2006 the sale of	's xscale assets was announced
intel		agreed to sell the xscale processor business to marvell technology group for an estimated 600 million and the assumption of unspecified liabilities
intel	the move was intended to permit	to focus its resources on its core x86 and server businesses and the acquisition completed on november 9 2006
intel	in 2010	purchased mcafee a manufacturer of computer security technology for 7.68 billion
intel	as a condition for regulatory approval of the transaction	agreed to provide rival security firms with all necessary information that would allow their products to use intel 's chips and personal computers

intel	in 2008	spun off key assets of a solar startup business effort to form an independent company spectrawatt inc
intel	in 2011 spectrawatt filed for bankruptcy.in february 2011	began to build a new microprocessor manufacturing facility in chandler arizona completed in 2013 at a cost of 5 billion
intel	the company produces three-quarters of its products in the united states although three-quarters of its revenue come from overseas.in april 2011	began a pilot project with zte corporation to produce smartphones using the intel atom processor for china 's domestic market
intel	in december 2011	announced that it reorganized several of its business units into a new mobile and communications group that would be responsible for the company 's smartphone tablet and wireless efforts
intel	finding itself with excess fab capacity after the failure of the ultrabook to gain market traction and with pc sales declining in 2013	reached a foundry agreement to produce chips for altera using 14-nm process
intel	general manager of	's custom foundry division sunit rikhi indicated that intel would pursue further such deals in the future
intel	this was after poor sales of windows 8 hardware caused a major retrenchment for most of the major semiconductor manufacturers except for qualcomm which continued to see healthy purchases from its largest customer apple.as of july 2013 five companies were using	's fabs via the intel custom foundry division achronix tabula netronome microsemi and panasonic – most are field-programmable gate array fpga makers but netronome designs network processors
intel	only achronix began shipping chips made by	using the 22-nm tri-gate process
intel	several other customers also exist but were not announced at the time.the alliance for affordable internet a4ai was launched in october 2013 and	is part of the coalition of public and private organisations that also includes facebook google and microsoft
intel		's first products were shift register memory and random-access memory integrated circuits and intel grew to be a leader in the fiercely competitive dram sram and rom markets throughout the 1970s
intel	concurrently	engineers marcian hoff federico faggin stanley mazor and masatoshi shima invented intel 's first microprocessor
intel	originally developed for the japanese company busicom to replace a number of asics in a calculator already produced by busicom the	4004 was introduced to the mass market on november 15 1971 though the microprocessor did not become the core of intel 's business until the mid-1980s
intel	note	is usually given credit with texas instruments for the almost-simultaneous invention of the microprocessor in 1983 at the dawn of the personal computer era intel 's profits came under increased pressure from japanese memory-chip manufacturers and then-president andy grove focused the company on microprocessors
intel	when the pc industry boomed in the late 1980s and 1990s	was one of the primary beneficiaries
intel	despite the ultimate importance of the microprocessor the 4004 and its successors the 8008 and the 8080 were never major revenue contributors at	
intel	as the next processor the 8086 and its variant the 8088 was completed in 1978	embarked on a major marketing and sales campaign for that chip nicknamed `` operation crush '' and intended to win as many customers for the processor as possible
intel	in 1982	created the 80286 microprocessor which two years later was used in the ibm pc/at
intel	compaq the first ibm pc `` clone '' manufacturer produced a desktop system based on the faster 80286 processor in 1985 and in 1986 quickly followed with the first 80386-based system beating ibm and establishing a competitive market for pc-compatible systems and setting up	as a key component supplier
intel	in 1975 the company had started a project to develop a highly advanced 32-bit microprocessor finally released in 1981 as the	iapx 432
intel		extended the x86 architecture to 32 bits instead
intel	the 8080 and 8086-series microprocessors were produced by several companies notably amd with which	had a technology-sharing contract
intel	in doing this	breached its contract with amd which sued and was paid millions of dollars in damages but could not manufacture new intel cpu designs any longer
intel	as the success of compaq 's deskpro 386 established the 386 as the dominant cpu choice	achieved a position of near-exclusive dominance as its supplier
intel	profits from this funded rapid development of both higher-performance chip designs and higher-performance manufacturing capabilities propelling	to a position of unquestioned leadership by the early 1990s
intel		introduced the 486 microprocessor in 1989 and in 1990 established a second design team designing the processors code-named `` p5 '' and `` p6 '' in parallel and committing to a major new processor every two years versus the four or more years such designs had previously taken
intel	engineers vinod dham and rajeev chandrasekhar member of parliament india were key figures on the core team that invented the 486 chip and later	's signature pentium chip
intel	the p5 was introduced in 1993 as the	pentium substituting a registered trademark name for the former part number numbers such as 486 can not be legally registered as trademarks in the united states
intel	the first attempt was dropped a year later but quickly revived in a cooperative program with hewlett-packard engineers though	soon took over primary design responsibility
intel	the itanium 's performance running legacy x86 code did not meet expectations and it failed to compete effectively with x86-64 which was amd 's 64-bit extension of the 32-bit x86 architecture	uses the name intel 64 previously em64t
intel	as of 2012	continues to develop and deploy the itanium known planning continues into 2014
intel	in june 1994	engineers discovered a flaw in the floating-point math subsection of the p5 pentium microprocessor
intel		corrected the error in a future chip revision and under public pressure it issued a total recall and replaced the defective pentium cpus which were limited to some 60 66 75 90 and 100 mhz models on customer request
intel	he contacted	but received no response
intel	consequently many users did not accept	's statements that the error was minor and `` not even an erratum ''
intel		changed its position and offered to replace every chip quickly putting in place a large end-user support organization
intel	this resulted in a 475 million charge against	's 1994 revenue
intel	dr. nicely later learned that	had discovered the fdiv bug in its own testing a few months before him but had decided not to inform customers .the `` pentium flaw '' incident intel 's response to it and the surrounding media coverage propelled intel from being a technology supplier generally unknown to most computer users to a household name
intel	dovetailing with an uptick in the ``	inside '' campaign the episode is considered to have been a positive event for intel changing some of its business practices to be more end-user focused and generating substantial public awareness while avoiding a lasting negative impression
intel	during this period	undertook two major supporting advertising campaigns
intel	the first campaign the 1991 ``	inside '' marketing and branding campaign is widely known and has become synonymous with intel itself
intel	this campaign established	which had been a component supplier little-known outside the pc industry as a household name
intel	the second campaign	's systems group which began in the early 1990s showcased manufacturing of pc motherboards the main board component of a personal computer and the one into which the processor cpu and memory ram chips are plugged
intel	the systems group campaign was lesser known than the	inside campaign
intel	shortly after	began manufacturing fully configured `` white box '' systems for the dozens of pc clone companies that rapidly sprang up
intel	at its peak in the mid-1990s	manufactured over 15 of all pcs making it the third-largest supplier at the time.during the 1990s intel architecture labs ial was responsible for many of the hardware innovations for the pc including the pci bus the pci express pcie bus and universal serial bus usb
intel	the competition between	and microsoft was revealed in testimony by then ial vice-president steven mcgeady at the microsoft antitrust trial united states v. microsoft corp.
intel	in early january 2018 it was reported that all	processors made since 1995 besides intel itanium and pre-2013 intel atom have been subject to two security flaws dubbed meltdown and spectre.the impact on performance resulting from software patches is `` workload-dependent ''
intel	it is believed that `` hundreds of millions '' of systems could be affected by these flaws.on march 15 2018	reported that it will redesign its cpu processors performance losses to be determined to protect against the spectre security vulnerability and expects to release the newly redesigned processors later in 2018.on may 3 2018 eight additional spectre-class flaws were reported
intel		reported that they are preparing new patches to mitigate these flaws.on august 14 2018 intel disclosed three additional chip flaws referred to as l1 terminal fault l1tf
intel		has decided to discontinue with their recent intel remote keyboard android app after encountering several security bugs
intel	this app was launched in early 2015 to help users control	single-board computers and intel nuc
intel	in 2008	began shipping mainstream solid-state drives ssds with up to 160 gb storage capacities
intel	as with their cpus	develops ssd chips using ever-smaller nanometer processes
intel	in 2017	introduced ssds based on 3d xpoint technology under the optane brand name
intel	the	scientific computers division was founded in 1984 by justin rattner to design and produce parallel computers based on intel microprocessors connected in hypercube internetwork topology
intel	in 1992 the name was changed to the	supercomputing systems division and development of the iwarp architecture was also subsumed
intel	the division designed several supercomputer systems including the	ipsc/1 ipsc/2 ipsc/860 paragon and asci red
intel	in november 2014	revealed that it is going to use light beams to speed up supercomputers
intel	in 2007	formed the moblin project to create an open source linux operating system for x86-based mobile devices
intel	following the success of google 's android platform which ran exclusively on arm processors	announced on february 15 2010 that it would partner with nokia and merge moblin with nokia 's arm-based maemo project to create meego
intel	meego was supported by the linux foundation.in february 2011 nokia left the project after partnering with microsoft leaving	in sole charge of meego
intel	an	spokeswoman said it was `` disappointed '' by nokia 's decision but that intel was committed to meego
intel	in september 2011	stopped working on meego and partnered with samsung to create tizen a new project hosted by the linux foundation

intel		has become one of the world 's most recognizable computer brands following its long-running intel inside campaign
intel	the idea for ``	inside '' came out of a meeting between intel and one of the major computer resellers microage.in the late 1980s intel 's market share was being seriously eroded by upstart competitors such as advanced micro devices now amd zilog and others who had started to sell their less expensive microprocessors to computer manufacturers
intel	in 1989	's dennis carter visited microage 's headquarters in tempe arizona to meet with microage 's vp of marketing ron mion
intel		wanted microage to petition its computer suppliers to favor intel chips
intel		's counterargument was that it would be too difficult to educate pc buyers on why intel microprocessors were worth paying more for ... and they were right
intel	but mion felt that the public did n't really need to fully understand why	chips were better they just needed to feel they were better
intel		would pay for a microage billboard somewhere saying `` if you 're buying a personal computer make sure it has intel inside ''
intel	in turn microage would put ``	inside '' stickers on the intel-based computers in their stores in that area
intel		very quickly adopted `` intel inside '' as its primary branding and rolled it out worldwide.as is often the case with computer lore other tidbits have been combined to explain how things evolved
intel	``	inside '' has not escaped that tendency and there are other `` explanations '' that had been floating around
intel		's branding campaign started with `` the computer inside '' tagline in 1990 in the us and europe
intel	the japan chapter of	proposed an `` intel in it '' tagline and kicked off the japanese campaign by hosting eki-kon meaning `` station concert '' in japanese at the tokyo railway station dome on christmas day december 25 1990
intel	several months later `` the computer inside '' incorporated the japan idea to become ``	inside '' which eventually elevated to the worldwide branding campaign in 1991 by intel marketing manager dennis carter
intel	the case study of the inside	inside was put together by harvard business school
intel	the initial branding agency for the ``	inside '' campaign was dahlinsmithwhite advertising of salt lake city
intel	the	swirl logo was the work of dahlinsmithwhite art director steve grigg under the direction of intel president and ceo andy grove.the intel inside advertising campaign sought public brand loyalty and awareness of intel processors in consumer computers
intel		paid some of the advertiser 's costs for an ad that used the intel inside logo and xylo-marimba jingle
intel	in 2008	planned to shift the emphasis of its intel inside campaign from traditional media such as television and print to newer media such as the internet
intel		required that a minimum of 35 of the money it provided to the companies in its co-op program be used for online marketing
intel	the	2010 annual financial report indicated that 1.8 billion 6 of the gross margin and nearly 16 of the total net income was allocated to all advertising with intel inside being part of that
intel	the sonic	logo was remade in 1999 to coincide with the launch of the pentium iii and a second time in 2004 to coincide with the new logo change although it overlapped with the 1999 version and was not mainstreamed until the launch of the core processors in 2006 with the melody unchanged
intel	advertisements for products featuring	processors with prominent mmx branding featured a version of the jingle with an embellishment after the final note
intel	in 2006	expanded its promotion of open specification platforms beyond centrino to include the viiv media center pc and the business desktop intel vpro
intel	in mid-january 2006	announced that they were dropping the long running pentium name from their processors
intel	the pentium name was first used to refer to the p5 core	processors and was done to comply with court rulings that prevent the trademarking of a string of numbers so competitors could not just call their processor the same name as had been done with the prior 386 and 486 processors both of which had copies manufactured by ibm and amd
intel	by 2009	was using a good-better-best strategy with celeron being good pentium better and the intel core family representing the best the company has to offer.according to spokesman bill calder intel has maintained only the celeron brand the atom brand for netbooks and the vpro lineup for businesses
intel	since late 2009	's mainstream processors have been called celeron pentium core i3 core i5 and core i7 in order of performance from lowest to highest
intel	vpro products will carry the	core i7 vpro processor or the intel core i5 vpro processor name

intel		has a significant participation in the open source communities since 1999
intel	for example in 2006	released mit-licensed x.org drivers for their integrated graphic cards of the i965 family of chipsets
intel		released freebsd drivers for some networking cards available under a bsd-compatible license which were also ported to openbsd
intel		ran the moblin project until april 23 2009 when they handed the project over to the linux foundation
intel		also runs the lesswatts.org campaigns.however after the release of the wireless products called intel pro/wireless 2100 2200bg/2225bg/2915abg and 3945abg in 2005 intel was criticized for not granting free redistribution rights for the firmware that must be included in the operating system for the wireless devices to operate
intel	as a result of this	became a target of campaigns to allow free operating systems to include binary firmware on terms acceptable to the open source community
intel	linspire-linux creator michael robertson outlined the difficult position that	was in releasing to open source as intel did not want to upset their large customer microsoft
intel	theo de raadt of openbsd also claimed that	is being `` an open source fraud '' after an intel employee presented a distorted view of the situation at an open-source conference
intel	in spite of the significant negative attention	received as a result of the wireless dealings the binary firmware still has not gained a license compatible with free software principles
intel	due to declining pc sales in 2016	cut 12,000 jobs
intel	in october 2006 a transmeta lawsuit was filed against	for patent infringement on computer architecture and power efficiency technologies

intel	both companies agreed to drop lawsuits against each other while	was granted a perpetual non-exclusive license to use current and future patented transmeta technologies in its chips for 10 years
intel	in september 2005	filed a response to an amd lawsuit disputing amd 's claims and claiming that intel 's business practices are fair and lawful
intel	in a rebuttal	deconstructed amd 's offensive strategy and argued that amd struggled largely as a result of its own bad business decisions including underinvestment in essential manufacturing capacity and excessive reliance on contracting out chip foundries
intel	legal analysts predicted the lawsuit would drag on for a number of years since	's initial response indicated its unwillingness to settle with amd
intel	in 2008 a court date was finally set but in 2009	settled with a 1.25 billion payout to amd see below .on november 4 2009 new york 's attorney general filed an antitrust lawsuit against intel corp claiming the company used `` illegal threats and collusion '' to dominate the market for computer microprocessors

intel	the allegations going back to 2003 include giving preferential prices to computer makers buying most or all of their chips from	paying computer makers to delay or cancel the launch of products using amd chips and providing chips at below standard cost to governments and educational institutions
intel		responded that the allegations were unfounded and instead qualified its market behavior as consumer-friendly
intel	general counsel bruce sewell responded that the commission had misunderstood some factual assumptions as to pricing and manufacturing costs.in february 2008	stated that its office in munich had been raided by european union regulators
intel		reported that it was cooperating with investigators
intel		faced a fine of up to 10 of its annual revenue if found guilty of stifling competition
intel	in june 2008 the eu filed new charges against	
intel	in may 2009 the eu found that	had engaged in anti-competitive practices and subsequently fined intel €1.06 billion us 1.44 billion a record amount
intel		was found to have paid companies including acer dell hp lenovo and nec to exclusively use intel chips in their products and therefore harmed other companies including amd
intel	the european commission said that	had deliberately acted to keep competitors out of the computer chip market and in doing so had made a `` serious and sustained violation of the eu 's antitrust rules ''
intel	in addition to the fine	was ordered by the commission to immediately cease all illegal practices
intel		has stated that they will appeal against the commission 's verdict
intel	in september 2007 south korean regulators accused	of breaking antitrust law
intel	the investigation began in february 2006 when officials raided	's south korean offices
intel	in june 2008 the fair trade commission ordered	to pay a fine of us 25.5 million for taking advantage of its dominant position to offer incentives to major korean pc manufacturers on the condition of not buying products from amd

intel	in december 2009 the ftc announced it would initiate an administrative proceeding against	in september 2010.in november 2009 following a two-year investigation new york attorney general andrew cuomo sued intel accusing them of bribery and coercion claiming that intel bribed computer makers to buy more of their chips than those of their rivals and threatened to withdraw these payments if the computer makers were perceived as working too closely with its competitors
intel		has denied these claims.on july 22 2010 dell agreed to a settlement with the u.s. securities and exchange commission sec to pay 100m in penalties resulting from charges that dell did not accurately disclose accounting information to investors
intel	in particular the sec charged that from 2002 to 2006 dell had an agreement with	to receive rebates in exchange for not using chips manufactured by amd
intel	dell eventually did adopt amd as a secondary supplier in 2006 and	subsequently stopped their rebates causing dell 's financial performance to fall
intel		has been accused by some residents of rio rancho new mexico of allowing vocs to be released in excess of their pollution permit
intel	one resident claimed that a release of 1.4 tons of carbon tetrachloride was measured from one acid scrubber during the fourth quarter of 2003 but an emission factor allowed	to report no carbon tetrachloride emissions for all of 2003.another resident alleges that intel was responsible for the release of other vocs from their rio rancho site and that a necropsy of lung tissue from two deceased dogs in the area indicated trace amounts of toluene hexane ethylbenzene and xylene isomers all of which are solvents used in industrial settings but also commonly found in gasoline retail paint thinners and retail solvents

intel	several other customers also exist but were not announced at the time.the alliance for affordable internet a4ai was launched in october 2013 and	is part of the coalition of public and private organisations that also includes facebook google and microsoft
intel		's first products were shift register memory and random-access memory integrated circuits and intel grew to be a leader in the fiercely competitive dram sram and rom markets throughout the 1970s
intel	concurrently	engineers marcian hoff federico faggin stanley mazor and masatoshi shima invented intel 's first microprocessor
intel	originally developed for the japanese company busicom to replace a number of asics in a calculator already produced by busicom the	4004 was introduced to the mass market on november 15 1971 though the microprocessor did not become the core of intel 's business until the mid-1980s
intel	note	is usually given credit with texas instruments for the almost-simultaneous invention of the microprocessor in 1983 at the dawn of the personal computer era intel 's profits came under increased pressure from japanese memory-chip manufacturers and then-president andy grove focused the company on microprocessors
intel	when the pc industry boomed in the late 1980s and 1990s	was one of the primary beneficiaries
intel	despite the ultimate importance of the microprocessor the 4004 and its successors the 8008 and the 8080 were never major revenue contributors at	
intel	as the next processor the 8086 and its variant the 8088 was completed in 1978	embarked on a major marketing and sales campaign for that chip nicknamed `` operation crush '' and intended to win as many customers for the processor as possible
intel	in 1982	created the 80286 microprocessor which two years later was used in the ibm pc/at
intel	compaq the first ibm pc `` clone '' manufacturer produced a desktop system based on the faster 80286 processor in 1985 and in 1986 quickly followed with the first 80386-based system beating ibm and establishing a competitive market for pc-compatible systems and setting up	as a key component supplier
intel	in 1975 the company had started a project to develop a highly advanced 32-bit microprocessor finally released in 1981 as the	iapx 432
intel		extended the x86 architecture to 32 bits instead
intel	the 8080 and 8086-series microprocessors were produced by several companies notably amd with which	had a technology-sharing contract
intel	in doing this	breached its contract with amd which sued and was paid millions of dollars in damages but could not manufacture new intel cpu designs any longer
intel	as the success of compaq 's deskpro 386 established the 386 as the dominant cpu choice	achieved a position of near-exclusive dominance as its supplier
intel	profits from this funded rapid development of both higher-performance chip designs and higher-performance manufacturing capabilities propelling	to a position of unquestioned leadership by the early 1990s
intel		introduced the 486 microprocessor in 1989 and in 1990 established a second design team designing the processors code-named `` p5 '' and `` p6 '' in parallel and committing to a major new processor every two years versus the four or more years such designs had previously taken
intel	engineers vinod dham and rajeev chandrasekhar member of parliament india were key figures on the core team that invented the 486 chip and later	's signature pentium chip
intel	the p5 was introduced in 1993 as the	pentium substituting a registered trademark name for the former part number numbers such as 486 can not be legally registered as trademarks in the united states
intel	the first attempt was dropped a year later but quickly revived in a cooperative program with hewlett-packard engineers though	soon took over primary design responsibility
intel	the itanium 's performance running legacy x86 code did not meet expectations and it failed to compete effectively with x86-64 which was amd 's 64-bit extension of the 32-bit x86 architecture	uses the name intel 64 previously em64t
intel	as of 2012	continues to develop and deploy the itanium known planning continues into 2014
intel	in june 1994	engineers discovered a flaw in the floating-point math subsection of the p5 pentium microprocessor
intel		corrected the error in a future chip revision and under public pressure it issued a total recall and replaced the defective pentium cpus which were limited to some 60 66 75 90 and 100 mhz models on customer request
intel	he contacted	but received no response
intel	consequently many users did not accept	's statements that the error was minor and `` not even an erratum ''
intel		changed its position and offered to replace every chip quickly putting in place a large end-user support organization
intel	this resulted in a 475 million charge against	's 1994 revenue
intel	dr. nicely later learned that	had discovered the fdiv bug in its own testing a few months before him but had decided not to inform customers .the `` pentium flaw '' incident intel 's response to it and the surrounding media coverage propelled intel from being a technology supplier generally unknown to most computer users to a household name
intel	dovetailing with an uptick in the ``	inside '' campaign the episode is considered to have been a positive event for intel changing some of its business practices to be more end-user focused and generating substantial public awareness while avoiding a lasting negative impression
intel	during this period	undertook two major supporting advertising campaigns
intel	the first campaign the 1991 ``	inside '' marketing and branding campaign is widely known and has become synonymous with intel itself
intel	this campaign established	which had been a component supplier little-known outside the pc industry as a household name
intel	the second campaign	's systems group which began in the early 1990s showcased manufacturing of pc motherboards the main board component of a personal computer and the one into which the processor cpu and memory ram chips are plugged
intel	the systems group campaign was lesser known than the	inside campaign
intel	shortly after	began manufacturing fully configured `` white box '' systems for the dozens of pc clone companies that rapidly sprang up
intel	at its peak in the mid-1990s	manufactured over 15 of all pcs making it the third-largest supplier at the time.during the 1990s intel architecture labs ial was responsible for many of the hardware innovations for the pc including the pci bus the pci express pcie bus and universal serial bus usb
intel	the competition between	and microsoft was revealed in testimony by then ial vice-president steven mcgeady at the microsoft antitrust trial united states v. microsoft corp.
intel	in early january 2018 it was reported that all	processors made since 1995 besides intel itanium and pre-2013 intel atom have been subject to two security flaws dubbed meltdown and spectre.the impact on performance resulting from software patches is `` workload-dependent ''
intel	it is believed that `` hundreds of millions '' of systems could be affected by these flaws.on march 15 2018	reported that it will redesign its cpu processors performance losses to be determined to protect against the spectre security vulnerability and expects to release the newly redesigned processors later in 2018.on may 3 2018 eight additional spectre-class flaws were reported
intel		reported that they are preparing new patches to mitigate these flaws.on august 14 2018 intel disclosed three additional chip flaws referred to as l1 terminal fault l1tf
intel		has decided to discontinue with their recent intel remote keyboard android app after encountering several security bugs
intel	this app was launched in early 2015 to help users control	single-board computers and intel nuc
intel	in 2008	began shipping mainstream solid-state drives ssds with up to 160 gb storage capacities
intel	as with their cpus	develops ssd chips using ever-smaller nanometer processes
intel	in 2017	introduced ssds based on 3d xpoint technology under the optane brand name
intel	the	scientific computers division was founded in 1984 by justin rattner to design and produce parallel computers based on intel microprocessors connected in hypercube internetwork topology
intel	in 1992 the name was changed to the	supercomputing systems division and development of the iwarp architecture was also subsumed
intel	the division designed several supercomputer systems including the	ipsc/1 ipsc/2 ipsc/860 paragon and asci red
intel	in november 2014	revealed that it is going to use light beams to speed up supercomputers
intel	in 2007	formed the moblin project to create an open source linux operating system for x86-based mobile devices
intel	following the success of google 's android platform which ran exclusively on arm processors	announced on february 15 2010 that it would partner with nokia and merge moblin with nokia 's arm-based maemo project to create meego
intel	meego was supported by the linux foundation.in february 2011 nokia left the project after partnering with microsoft leaving	in sole charge of meego
intel	an	spokeswoman said it was `` disappointed '' by nokia 's decision but that intel was committed to meego
intel	in september 2011	stopped working on meego and partnered with samsung to create tizen a new project hosted by the linux foundation
intel		has since been co-developing the tizen operating system which runs on several samsung devices
intel		's strategy of producing ever-more-powerful processors and obsoleting their predecessors stumbled leaving an opportunity for rapid gains by competitors notably amd
intel		's market dominance at one time it controlled over 85 of the market for 32-bit x86 microprocessors combined with intel 's own hardball legal tactics such as its infamous 338 patent suit versus pc manufacturers made it an attractive target for litigation but few of the lawsuits ever amounted to anything.a case of industrial espionage arose in 1995 that involved both intel and amd
intel	bill gaede an argentine formerly employed both at amd and at	's arizona plant was arrested for attempting in 1993 to sell the i486 and p5 pentium designs to amd and to certain foreign powers
intel	gaede videotaped data from his computer screen at	and mailed it to amd which immediately alerted intel and authorities resulting in gaede 's arrest
intel	on june 6 2005 steve jobs then ceo of apple announced that apple would be transitioning from its long favored powerpc architecture to the	x86 architecture because the future powerpc road map was unable to satisfy apple 's needs
intel	the first macintosh computers containing	cpus were announced on january 10 2006 and apple had its entire line of consumer macs running on intel processors by early august 2006
intel	the apple xserve server was updated to	xeon processors from november 2006 and was offered in a configuration similar to apple 's mac pro
intel	in july 2007 the company released a print advertisement for its	core 2 duo processor featuring six african-american runners appearing to bow down to a caucasian male inside of an office setting due to the posture taken by runners on starting blocks
intel	according to nancy bhagat vice president of	corporate marketing viewers found the ad to be `` insensitive and insulting '' and several intel executives made public apologies
intel	in june 2011	introduced the first pentium mobile processor based on the sandy bridge core
intel	according to ihs isuppli 's report on september 28 2011 sandy bridge chips have helped	increase its market share in global processor market to 81.8 while amd 's market share dropped to 10.4 .intel planned to introduce medfield – a processor for tablets and smartphones – to the market in 2012 as an effort to compete with arm
intel	as a 32-nanometer processor medfield is designed to be energy-efficient which is one of the core features in arm 's chips.at the	developers forum idf 2011 in san francisco intel 's partnership with google was announced

intel		plans to improve power consumption of its chips for ultrabooks like new ivy bridge processors in 2013 which will only have 10w default thermal design power.intel 's goal for ultrabook 's price is below 1000 however according to two presidents from acer and compaq this goal will not be achieved if intel does not lower the price of its chips
intel		has become one of the world 's most recognizable computer brands following its long-running intel inside campaign
intel	the idea for ``	inside '' came out of a meeting between intel and one of the major computer resellers microage.in the late 1980s intel 's market share was being seriously eroded by upstart competitors such as advanced micro devices now amd zilog and others who had started to sell their less expensive microprocessors to computer manufacturers
intel	in 1989	's dennis carter visited microage 's headquarters in tempe arizona to meet with microage 's vp of marketing ron mion
intel		wanted microage to petition its computer suppliers to favor intel chips
intel		's counterargument was that it would be too difficult to educate pc buyers on why intel microprocessors were worth paying more for ... and they were right
intel	but mion felt that the public did n't really need to fully understand why	chips were better they just needed to feel they were better
intel		would pay for a microage billboard somewhere saying `` if you 're buying a personal computer make sure it has intel inside ''
intel	in turn microage would put ``	inside '' stickers on the intel-based computers in their stores in that area
intel		very quickly adopted `` intel inside '' as its primary branding and rolled it out worldwide.as is often the case with computer lore other tidbits have been combined to explain how things evolved
intel	``	inside '' has not escaped that tendency and there are other `` explanations '' that had been floating around
intel		's branding campaign started with `` the computer inside '' tagline in 1990 in the us and europe
intel	the japan chapter of	proposed an `` intel in it '' tagline and kicked off the japanese campaign by hosting eki-kon meaning `` station concert '' in japanese at the tokyo railway station dome on christmas day december 25 1990
intel	several months later `` the computer inside '' incorporated the japan idea to become ``	inside '' which eventually elevated to the worldwide branding campaign in 1991 by intel marketing manager dennis carter
intel	the case study of the inside	inside was put together by harvard business school
intel	the initial branding agency for the ``	inside '' campaign was dahlinsmithwhite advertising of salt lake city
intel	the	swirl logo was the work of dahlinsmithwhite art director steve grigg under the direction of intel president and ceo andy grove.the intel inside advertising campaign sought public brand loyalty and awareness of intel processors in consumer computers
intel		paid some of the advertiser 's costs for an ad that used the intel inside logo and xylo-marimba jingle
intel	in 2008	planned to shift the emphasis of its intel inside campaign from traditional media such as television and print to newer media such as the internet
intel		required that a minimum of 35 of the money it provided to the companies in its co-op program be used for online marketing
intel	the	2010 annual financial report indicated that 1.8 billion 6 of the gross margin and nearly 16 of the total net income was allocated to all advertising with intel inside being part of that
intel	the sonic	logo was remade in 1999 to coincide with the launch of the pentium iii and a second time in 2004 to coincide with the new logo change although it overlapped with the 1999 version and was not mainstreamed until the launch of the core processors in 2006 with the melody unchanged
intel	advertisements for products featuring	processors with prominent mmx branding featured a version of the jingle with an embellishment after the final note
intel	in 2006	expanded its promotion of open specification platforms beyond centrino to include the viiv media center pc and the business desktop intel vpro
intel	in mid-january 2006	announced that they were dropping the long running pentium name from their processors
intel	the pentium name was first used to refer to the p5 core	processors and was done to comply with court rulings that prevent the trademarking of a string of numbers so competitors could not just call their processor the same name as had been done with the prior 386 and 486 processors both of which had copies manufactured by ibm and amd
intel	by 2009	was using a good-better-best strategy with celeron being good pentium better and the intel core family representing the best the company has to offer.according to spokesman bill calder intel has maintained only the celeron brand the atom brand for netbooks and the vpro lineup for businesses
intel	since late 2009	's mainstream processors have been called celeron pentium core i3 core i5 and core i7 in order of performance from lowest to highest
intel	vpro products will carry the	core i7 vpro processor or the intel core i5 vpro processor name
intel	in october 2011	started to sell its core i7-2700k `` sandy bridge '' chip to customers worldwide.since 2010 `` centrino '' is only being applied to intel 's wimax and wi-fi technologies
intel	neo sans	is a customized version of neo sans based on the neo sans and neo tech designed by sebastian lester in 2004.intel clear is a global font announced in 2014 designed for to be used across all communications
intel	initially available in latin greek and cyrillic scripts it replaced neo sans	as the company 's corporate typeface
intel		clear hebrew intel clear arabic were added by daltan maag ltd. it is a book produced by red peak branding as part of new brand identity campaign celebrating intel 's achievements while setting the new standard for what intel looks feels and sounds like
intel		has a significant participation in the open source communities since 1999
intel	for example in 2006	released mit-licensed x.org drivers for their integrated graphic cards of the i965 family of chipsets
intel		released freebsd drivers for some networking cards available under a bsd-compatible license which were also ported to openbsd
intel		ran the moblin project until april 23 2009 when they handed the project over to the linux foundation
intel		also runs the lesswatts.org campaigns.however after the release of the wireless products called intel pro/wireless 2100 2200bg/2225bg/2915abg and 3945abg in 2005 intel was criticized for not granting free redistribution rights for the firmware that must be included in the operating system for the wireless devices to operate
intel	as a result of this	became a target of campaigns to allow free operating systems to include binary firmware on terms acceptable to the open source community
intel	linspire-linux creator michael robertson outlined the difficult position that	was in releasing to open source as intel did not want to upset their large customer microsoft
intel	theo de raadt of openbsd also claimed that	is being `` an open source fraud '' after an intel employee presented a distorted view of the situation at an open-source conference
intel	in spite of the significant negative attention	received as a result of the wireless dealings the binary firmware still has not gained a license compatible with free software principles
intel	due to declining pc sales in 2016	cut 12,000 jobs
intel	in october 2006 a transmeta lawsuit was filed against	for patent infringement on computer architecture and power efficiency technologies
intel	the lawsuit was settled in october 2007 with	agreeing to pay us 150 million initially and us 20 million per year for the next five years
intel	both companies agreed to drop lawsuits against each other while	was granted a perpetual non-exclusive license to use current and future patented transmeta technologies in its chips for 10 years
intel	in september 2005	filed a response to an amd lawsuit disputing amd 's claims and claiming that intel 's business practices are fair and lawful

kkr		's final bid of 109 while a lower dollar figure was ultimately accepted by the board of directors of rjr nabisco
kkr		's offer was guaranteed whereas the management offer lacked a `` reset '' meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their stated 112 per share.additionally many in rjr 's board of directors had grown concerned at recent disclosures of ross johnson 's unprecedented golden parachute deal

mylan		acquired the right to market and distribute the epipen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from merck kgaa as part of their 2007 deal that right had formerly been held by dey lp a wholly owned subsidiary of merck
mylan		's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when sanofi 's competing product was recalled in november 2015 and further when teva 's generic competitor was rejected by the fda in march 2016.by the first half of 2015 mylan had an 85 market share of such devices in the us and in that year sales reached around 1.5b and accounted for 40 of mylan 's profit
mylan	those profits were also due in part to	's continually raising the price of epipens starting in 2009 in 2009 the wholesale price of two epipens was about 100 by july 2013 the price was about 265 in may 2015 it was around 461 and in may 2016 the price rose again to around 609 around a 500 jump from the price in 2009.starting in 2014 according to a 2017 report in the new york times mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the epi-pen and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical the times reported that when these concerns were brought to robert coury the chairman of the board coury `` replied that he was untroubled
mylan	he raised both his middle fingers and explained using colorful language that anyone criticizing	including its employees ought to go copulate with themselves
mylan	the times reporter noted that `` those top leaders ’ responses are a far cry from the message on	’ s website which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo and that 'we put people and patients first trusting that profits will follow
mylan	in the summer of 2016 as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new epipens people began to express outrage at the cost of the epipen and	was widely and harshly criticized including criticism from martin shkreli `` poster boy for grasping pharma greed '' letters from two senators and initiation of congressional investigations
mylan		's pricing of the epipen was widely referred to as price gouging
mylan	the last price increase coincided with	's airing of a new line of tv commercials that were described as `` shocking '' and `` no holds barred '' depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses
mylan	in response to criticism	increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase epipens a gesture that was called a `` classic public relations move '' by harvard medical school professor aaron kesselheim
mylan	they do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.mylan further responded by releasing the first authorized generic version of the epipen in december 2016 at a more than 50 discount.in september 2016 the new york state attorney general began an investigation into	's epipen4schools program in new york to determine if the program 's contracts violated antitrust law and the west virginia state attorney general opened an investigation into whether mylan had given the state the correct discount under the medicaid drug rebate program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.in october 2016 the ceo of mylan testified to congress that pfizer/king charged mylan about 34.50 for one device
mylan	in september 2016 a silicon valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the epipen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about 10 for a two-pack.according to the department of health and human services office of inspector general analysis the u.s. government may have overpaid `` as much as 1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016 '' to drugmaker	n.v. for the epipen emergency allergy treatment
mylan	this represents three times the proposed settlement of 465 million announced by	in october 2016
mylan	in october 2016	announced a settlement with the us department of justice over rebates paid by mylan to states under the medicaid drug rebate program
mylan	under the agreement	agreed to pay a 465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates
mylan	simultaneously with the settlement	also announced it was being investigated by the securities and exchange commission related to the drug rebate program
mylan	on the same day a group of	`` investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company 's directors after it paid chairman robert coury over 97 million last year ''
mylan		manufactures rocuronium bromide which is approved by the state of alabama for use in executions by lethal injection
mylan	european manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the united states except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.in september 2014 the london-based human rights organization reprieve told	that they were the only fda-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions and there was `` a very real risk that mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country ''
mylan	the german asset manager dje kapital divested itself of 70 million in	shares for that reason
mylan		said that their distribution was `` legally compliant '' and that their restrictions did `` prohibit resale to correctional facilities for use in lethal injections ''

netflix	the rise of	has affected the way audiences watch televised content
netflix		's cpo neil hunt points out that because the internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week because they can just binge straight into the next episode
netflix		has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30 minute or 60 minute timeslots once a week which it claims gives them an advantage over networks

netflix	the	model has also affected viewers expectations
netflix		has successfully continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once acknowledging changing viewer habits
netflix		has capitalized on these habits by automatically playing the next episode in the series removing the 15-second wait times of content on other streaming services
netflix	the structure that allows convenient viewing of episodes as well as the intent to provide content of quality comparable to some broadcast and cable television programs in effect often results in the viewer being hooked into the program by the time the next episode starts.in june 2016 russian minister of culture vladimir medinsky asserted that	is part of the us government plot to influence the world culture `` to enter every home get into every television and through that television into the head of every person on earth ''

novartis		lost that case and did not appeal

novartis	the supreme court decided that the substance that	sought to patent was indeed a modification of a known drug the raw form of imatinib which was publicly disclosed in the 1993 patent application and in scientific articles that novartis did not present evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the final form of gleevec and the raw form of imatinib and that therefore the patent application was properly rejected by the patent office and lower courts.although the court ruled narrowly and took care to note that the subject application was filed during a time of transition in indian patent law the decision generated widespread global news coverage and reignited debates on balancing public good with monopolistic pricing innovation with affordability etc.had novartis won and gotten its patent issued it could not have prevented generics companies in india from continuing to sell generic gleevec but it could have obligated them to pay a reasonable royalty under a grandfather clause included in india 's patent law.in reaction to the decision ranjit shahani vice-chairman and managing director of novartis india ltd was quoted as saying `` this ruling is a setback for patients that will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options ''

symantec		corporation commonly known as symantec is an american software company headquartered in mountain view california united states
symantec		is a fortune 500 company and a member of the s p 500 stock-market index
symantec	on october 9 2014	declared it would split into two independent publicly traded companies by the end of 2015
symantec	on january 29 2016	sold its information-management subsidiary named veritas technologies which symantec had acquired in 2004 to the carlyle group.the name `` symantec '' is a portmanteau of the words `` syntax '' and `` semantics '' with `` technology ''
symantec	founded in 1982 by gary hendrix with a national science foundation grant	was originally focused on artificial intelligence-related projects including a database program
symantec	hendrix also hired jerry kaplan entrepreneur and author as a consultant to build the in-ram database for q a.in 1984 it became clear that the advanced natural language and database system that	had developed could not be ported from dec minicomputers to the pc
symantec	this left	without a product but with expertise in natural language database query systems and technology
symantec	as a result later in 1984	was acquired by another smaller software startup company c e software founded by denis coleman and gordon eubanks and headed by eubanks
symantec	`` the merged company retained the name	
symantec	eubanks became its chairman vern raburn the former president of the original	remained as president of the combined company
symantec	the new	combined the file management and word processing functionality that c e had planned and added an advanced natural language query system designed by gary hendrix and engineered by dan gordon that set new standards for ease of database query and report generation
symantec	turner chose the name of q a for	's flagship product in large part because the name lent itself to use in a short easily merchandised logo
symantec	during 1986 vern raburn and gordon eubanks swapped roles and eubanks became ceo and president of	while raburn became its chairman
symantec	subsequent to this change raburn had little involvement with	and in a few years time eubanks added the chairmanship to his other roles
symantec	after a slow start for sales of q a in the fall of 1985 and spring of 1986 turner signed up a new advertising agency called elliott/dickens embarked on an aggressive new advertising campaign and came up with the `` six pack program '' in which all	employees regardless of role went on the road training and selling dealer sales staff nationwide in the united states
symantec	simultaneously a promotion was run jointly with sofsell which was	's exclusive wholesale distributor in the united states for the first year that q a was on the market
symantec	during this time	was advised by jim lally and john doerr — both were board members of symantec at that stage — kleiner perkins caufield byers that if symantec would cut its expenses and grow revenues enough to achieve cash flow break-even then kpcb would back the company in raising more venture capital
symantec	eubanks also negotiated a sizable rent reduction on the office space the company had leased in the days of the original	
symantec	the significantly increased traction for q a from this re-launch grew	's revenues substantially along with early success for q a in international markets uniquely a german version was shipped three weeks after the united states version and it was the first software in the world that supported german natural language following turner 's having placed emphasis on establishing international sales distribution and multiple language versions of q a from initial shipment
symantec	in 1985 rod turner negotiated the publishing agreement with david whitney for	's second product which turner named noteit an annotation utility for lotus 1-2-3
symantec	it was evident to turner that noteit would confuse the dealer channel if it was launched under the	name because symantec had built up interest by that stage in q a but not yet shipped it and because the low price for the utility would not be initially attractive to the dealer channel until demand had been built up
symantec	turner and gordon e. eubanks jr. then chairman of	corporation agreed to form a new division of symantec and eubanks delegated the choice of name to turner
symantec	turner chose the name turner hall publishing to be a new division of	devoted to publishing third-party software and hardware
symantec	the objective of the division was to diversify revenues and accelerate the growth of	
symantec	turner hall publishing 's first offering was note-it a notation utility add-in for lotus 1-2-3 which was developed by david whitney and licensed to	
symantec	its second product was the turner hall card which was a 256k ram half slot memory card initially made to inexpensively increase the available memory for	's flagship product q a
symantec	the popularity of these products while contributing a relatively small portion of revenues to	conveyed the impression that symantec was already a diversified company and indeed many industry participants were under the impression that symantec had acquired turner hall publishing
symantec	revenues from q a and from	's early launch into the international marketplace combined with turner hall publishing generated the market presence and scale that enabled symantec to make its first merger/acquisition in february 1987 that of breakthrough software maker of the timeline project management software for dos

wachovia	on may 31 2007	announced plans to purchase a. g. edwards for 6.8 billion to create the united states second largest retail brokerage firm
wachovia	in early march 2008	began to phase out the ag edwards brand in favor of a unified wachovia securities
wachovia		excluding subsidiaries was the fourth largest bank at the end of 2008
wachovia	exposed to risky loans such as adjustable rate mortgages acquired during the acquisition of golden west financial in 2006	began to experience heavy losses in its loan portfolios during the subprime mortgage crisis.in the first quarter of 2007 wachovia reported 2.3 billion in earnings including acquisitions and divestitures
wachovia	however in the second quarter of 2008	reported a much larger than anticipated 8.9 billion loss.on june 2 2008 wachovia chief executive officer ken thompson was forced to retire
wachovia	he 'd been head of	since 2000 while it was still known as first union
wachovia	on july 9 2008	hired treasury undersecretary bob steel as chief executive in hopes that his experience would lead the company out of its difficulties
wachovia	after steel took over he insisted that	would stay independent
wachovia	ultimately	lost a total of 5 billion in deposits that day—about one percent of the bank 's total deposits
wachovia	federal regulators pressured	to put itself up for sale over the weekend
wachovia	had	failed it would have been a severe drain on the fdic 's insurance fund due to its size it operated one of the largest branch networks on the east coast .as business halted for the weekend wachovia was already in fdic-brokered talks with citigroup and wells fargo
wachovia	wells fargo initially emerged as the frontrunner to acquire the ailing	's banking operations but backed out due to concerns over wachovia 's commercial loans
wachovia	with no deal in place as september 28 dawned regulators were concerned that	would n't have enough short-term funding to open for business the next day
wachovia	under the circumstances regulators feared that if customers pulled out more money	would n't have enough liquidity to meet its obligations
wachovia	this would have resulted in a failure dwarfing that of wamu.when fdic chairwoman sheila bair got word of	's situation she initially decided to handle the situation like she 'd handled wamu a day earlier
wachovia	under this scenario the comptroller of the currency would have seized	's banking assets wachovia bank n.a
wachovia	and	bank of delaware n.a
wachovia	bair called steel on september 28 and told him that the fdic would be auctioning off	's banking assets
wachovia	however several federal regulators led by new york fed president tim geithner felt such a course would be politically unjustifiable so soon after wamu 's seizure.after a round of mediation between geithner and bair the fdic declared that	was `` systemically important '' to the health of the economy and thus could not be allowed to fail
wachovia	later that night in an fdic-brokered deal citigroup agreed to buy	's retail banking operations in an `` open bank '' transfer of ownership
wachovia	from this point on citigroup became the source of liquidity allowing	to continue to operate until the acquisition was complete
wachovia	in its announcement the fdic stressed that	did not fail and was not placed into receivership
wachovia	in addition the fdic said that the agency would absorb citigroup 's losses above 42 billion	's loan portfolio was valued at 312 billion
wachovia	the transaction would have been an all-stock transfer with	corporation stockholders to have received stock from citigroup valuing wachovia stock at about one dollar per share for a total transaction value of about 2.16 billion
wachovia	citigroup would have also assumed	's senior and subordinated debt
wachovia	the proposed closing date for the	purchase was by the end of the year 2008.wachovia expected to continue as a publicly traded company retaining its retail brokerage arm wachovia securities and evergreen mutual funds
wachovia	at the time	securities had 14,600 financial advisers and managed more than 1 trillion third in the u.s. after merrill lynch and citigroup 's smith barney.the announcement drew some criticism from wachovia stockholders who felt the dollar-per-share price was too cheap
wachovia	however institutional investors such as mutual funds and pension funds controlled 73 percent of	's stock individual stockholders would have had to garner a significant amount of support from institutional shareholders to derail the sale
wachovia	one financial expert told the observer that if	's shareholders voted the deal down the occ could have simply seized wachovia and placed it into the receivership of the fdic which would then sell it to citigroup
wachovia	had this happened	's shareholders risked being completely wiped out
wachovia	though citigroup was providing the liquidity that allowed	to continue to operate wells fargo and wachovia announced on october 3 2008 that they had agreed to merge in an all-stock transaction requiring no government involvement
wachovia	wells fargo announced it had agreed to acquire all of	for 15.1 billion in stock
wachovia		preferred the wells fargo deal because it would be worth more than the citigroup deal and keep all of its businesses intact
wachovia	also there is far less overlap between the banks as wells fargo is dominant in the west and midwest compared to the redundant footprint of	and citibank along the east coast
wachovia	both companies boards unanimously approved the merger on the night of october 2.citigroup explored its legal options and demanded that	and wells fargo cease discussions claiming that wells fargo engaged in `` tortious interference '' with an exclusivity agreement between citigroup and wachovia
wachovia	that agreement states in part that until october 6 2008 ``	shall not and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries or any of its or their respective officers directors take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any acquisition proposal
wachovia	this ruling was later overturned by judge james m. mcguire of the supreme court of the state of new york appellate division first department partly because he believed ramos did not have the right to rule on the case in connecticut.on october 9 2008 citigroup abandoned its attempt to purchase	's banking assets allowing the wachovia-wells fargo merger to go through
wachovia	however citigroup pursued 60 billion in claims 20 billion in compensatory and 40 billion in punitive damages against	and wells fargo for alleged violations of the exclusivity agreement
wachovia	however charlotte remained as the headquarters for the combined company 's east coast banking operations and	securities remained in charlotte
wachovia	three members of the	board joined the wells fargo board
wachovia	in filings unsealed two days before the merger approval in a new york federal court citigroup argued that its own deal was better for u.s taxpayers and	shareholders
wachovia	it said that it had exposed itself to `` substantial economic risk '' by stating its intent to rescue	after less than 72 hours of due diligence
wachovia		suffered a 23.9 billion loss in the third quarter.in september 2008 the internal revenue service issued a notice providing tax breaks to companies that acquire troubled banks
wachovia	vice chairman bill thomas of the financial crisis inquiry commission indicated that these tax breaks may have been a factor in wells fargo 's decision to purchase wachovia.wells fargo 's purchase of	closed on december 31 2008
wachovia	by the time wells fargo completed the acquisition of	the byline `` a wells fargo company '' was added to the logo
wachovia	a may 2007 new york times article described	's negligence in screening and taking action against companies linked with identity theft
wachovia	with stolen identities the companies used unsigned checks to remove funds from personal	bank accounts
wachovia	in total	accepted 142 million in unsigned checks from `` companies that made unauthorized withdrawals from thousands of accounts '' collecting millions of dollars in fees from them
wachovia	according to pat meehan a u.s. attorney for eastern district of pennsylvania	received `` thousands of warnings that it was processing fraudulent checks but ignored them '' .on april 25 2008 wachovia agreed to pay up to 144 million to end the investigation without admitting wrongdoing
wachovia	the investigation found that	had failed to conduct suitable due diligence and that it would have discovered the thefts if it had followed normal procedures
wachovia	in april 2008 the wall street journal reported that federal prosecutors had initiated a probe into	and other u.s. banks for aiding drug money laundering by mexican and colombian money-transfer companies also known as casas de cambio
wachovia	however not only is it a `` lucrative industry '' that is able to charge high fees but	also viewed it as a way to gain a foothold in the hispanic banking market.in march 2010 wachovia admitted `` serious and systemic '' violations of the bank secrecy act that allowed mexican and colombian drug cartels to launder 378.4 billion between 2004 and 2007 the `` largest violation of the bank secrecy act ''
wachovia	reports in bloomberg businessweek in june 2010 and the observer in april 2011 shed light on the extent to which	went to turn a blind eye including by ignoring the warnings and suspicious activity reports sars of its london-based director of anti-money-laundering
